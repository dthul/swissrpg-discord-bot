        <h2>Connect your Meetup and Discord profiles</h2>
        <p>
            Most SwissRPG games have a private channel on Discord where you can
            discuss with the Game Master and other players, get information
            about the adventure, create your character before the game and ask
            questions. In order to give you access to the Discord channels of
            the games you register to, we need to connect your Meetup and
            Discord profiles.
